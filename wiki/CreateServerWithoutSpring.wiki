== Implements a BeanLocator ==

BeanLocator has only one implementation in missian: SpringLocator, but it does not work without spring, so we have to implement one, for example:
{{{
public class ExampleBeanLocator implements BeanLocator{

	@Override
	public Object lookup(String beanName) {
		if(beanName.equals("hello")) {
			return new HelloImpl();
		}
		throw new IllegalArgumentException("No bean was found:"+beanName);
	}

}
}}}
